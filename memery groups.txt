1) small groups, like sigma nu -> pictures of other members (or memebers, excuse the pun). Inside jokes that no one will get. Doesn't contain a lot of content. Probably will not make use of memegr and gallery.

2) Large groups, like Penn -> lots of public images (like the ben franklin statue), inside jokes that the community will get. Lots of content that's uploaded by all its users. Memgr and gallery important. Information not sensitive (even if it's a private group)

3)Large public groups -> topics such as nyan cat, or awkward penguin, diablo..etc. Specific jokes releated to those topics that the public will mostly get. Massive amounts of content uploaded by anyone. Memgr and gallery supper important at filtering away the shitty memes. Information not sensitive
